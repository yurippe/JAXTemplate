# JAXTemplate
JAX Template for handin 4 in dWebTek at Aarhus University

#Information
This is the webtek template made to work with IntelliJ IDE

At the moment it is set up with Tomcat 7.0.42, this is the only thing you have to change to make it work for you

#How to add Tomcat version:
* Go to File -> Project Structure -> Modules
* You should see this:
![alt tag]()
* (You can safely leave the old Tomcat there, this way we can work on the same project with different Tomcat versions)
* Click on the little + symbol to the right (see screenshot)
![alt tag]()
* Click Library...
* Find Tomcat under Application Server Libraries
* Click add Selected
* Click OK or Apply and your project should be good to go.
